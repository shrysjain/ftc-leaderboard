## Accessing Data via REST API

This project provides a publicly available REST API endpoint to access the top 10 match scores for any region. You can use this API to fetch raw JSON data for your own projects.

### API Endpoints

To get the top 10 match scores for a specific region, use the following URL pattern:

```sh
/api/scores/{region_code}
```

Replace `{region_code}` with the appropriate code for the region you are interested in. Here are a few examples:

For the Chesapeake region:

```sh
/api/scores/chs
```

For the Alberta region:

```sh
/api/scores/ab
```

For the Australia region:

```sh
/api/scores/aus
```

You can find region codes in the URL of any specific region's page on FTC Leaderboard as the string of characters following the forward slash.

### Sample Request

To fetch data for the Chesapeake region, you can make an HTTP GET request to:

```sh
https://ftc-leaderboard.vercel.app/api/scores/chs
```

### Sample Response

The API will return a JSON response with the top 10 match scores for the specified region. A sample response might look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "score": "301",
    "auto": "115",
    "teleOp": "96",
    "end": "90",
    "autoTaskPts": "80",
